# Multi-Factor Authentication System with Firebase

## Overview

This project implements a robust multi-factor authentication (MFA) system leveraging Firebase Authentication. The system supports biometric authentication (e.g., fingerprint, face ID) and secondary authentication methods (OTP). It integrates Auth 2.0 for third-party authentication and authorization, ensuring compliance with industry standards and security best practices. Additionally, end-to-end encryption using Firebase is employed for sensitive user data storage and transmission to safeguard data privacy and confidentiality.

## Features

- **Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA):**
  - Supports biometric authentication (fingerprint, face ID).
  - Secondary authentication methods include OTP (One-Time Password) and OTP.

- **Integration with Auth 2.0:**
  - Seamlessly integrates with Auth 2.0 authorization framework for third-party authentication and authorization.
  - Ensures compliance with industry standards and security best practices.

- **End-to-End Encryption:**
  - Implements end-to-end encryption for sensitive user data storage and transmission.
  - Leverages Firebase's cryptographic capabilities using algorithms like RSA.

## Technologies Used

- Firebase Authentication: For user authentication and authorization.
- Auth 2.0: Integrated for seamless third-party authentication and authorization.
- Firebase Firestore: For storing sensitive user data.
- Firebase Cloud Functions: For implementing custom authentication triggers and backend logic.
- Cryptographic Algorithms (RSA): Utilized for end-to-end encryption.

## Setup Instructions

1. **Firebase Setup:**
   - Create a Firebase project in the Firebase console (https://console.firebase.google.com/project/hamazhcll/overview).
   - Enable Firebase Authentication and choose the desired authentication methods.
   - Set up Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore for data storage.
   - Configure Firebase Cloud Functions for custom authentication triggers if needed.

2. **Auth 2.0 Integration:**
   - Register your application with the desired Auth 2.0 provider (e.g., Auth0).
   - Follow the provider's documentation to integrate Auth 2.0 with your Firebase project.

3. **End-to-End Encryption:**
   - Enable encryption settings in Firebase Realtime Database or Firestore.
   - Implement encryption/decryption logic using RSA algorithms for sensitive data.

4. **Code Implementation:**
   - Clone this repository to your local machine.
   - Configure Firebase SDK in your project and replace the necessary configurations.
   - Implement authentication and authorization logic in your application code.

5. **Testing and Deployment:**
   - Test the MFA system thoroughly with various authentication methods.
   - Ensure compliance with industry standards and security best practices.
   - Deploy your application to your preferred hosting platform.
